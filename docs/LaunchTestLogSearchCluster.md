# Launch a local test LogSearch cluster

The LogSearch Workspace contains a copy of bosh-lite, which enables you to deploy a local LogSearch cluster using Linux Containers rather than actual VMs.

This provides a quick and cheap way to simluate running a LogSearch cluster

0. SSH into your workspace
0. Navigate to the test environment

        cd ~/environments/test

0. Ensure the `bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent` stemcell exists

        bosh stemcells
        
    If you see `No stemcells`, then you need to upload the latest `warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty` stemcell:
    
        bosh upload stemcell http://bosh-jenkins-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-stemcell/warden/latest-bosh-stemcell-warden.tgz
        
    You should see:

0. Ensure the latest version of the `logsearch` bosh release exists

        bosh releases
        
    If you see `No releases`, then you need to upload the latest `logsearch` bosh release:
    
        bosh upload release https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ci-logsearch/releases/logsearch/logsearch-17.tgz

    * From inside the Workspace you can access these IPs directly, eg: `curl 10.244.10.2`

            {
              "status" : 200,
              "name" : "api/0",
              "version" : {
                "number" : "1.2.1",
                "build_hash" : "6c95b759f9e7ef0f8e17f77d850da43ce8a4b364",
                "build_timestamp" : "2014-06-03T15:02:52Z",
                "build_snapshot" : false,
                "lucene_version" : "4.8"
              },
              "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
             }

    * Port mappings have been set up between the Workspace's external IP and these internal IPs.  You can see what these are using `cat ~/port_mappings.txt` :
    
            Port Mappings:
              192.168.50.4:10080 -> 10.244.10.2:80
              192.168.50.4:10443 -> 10.244.10.6:443
     
      Thus, from outside the Workspace (eg, in your browser), the same curl request can be made using `192.168.50.4:10080`
      
0.  Ship in data
      * @todo - point to scripts that inject some test data

0.  Browse to Kibana
      * Kibana is installed on the API node.  You can access it via a browser external to the Workspace using `http://$workspace_external_ip:$port/_plugin/kibana`, eg `http://192.168.50.4:10080/_plugin/kibana`
